## Server Data Cleanup

PocketSync implements a systematic approach to maintain optimal database performance through periodic cleanup of processed changes while ensuring data integrity and sync reliability.

### Change Processing Strategy

To prevent redundant updates and ensure efficient synchronization, the server processes changes before distributing them to client devices:

#### Change Consolidation

##### Identifying the Most Recent Change Per Row
- If the latest change to a row is a deletion, the row is discarded from the change set
- Updates to the same row are merged based on timestamps and versions to avoid redundant operations
- Only the final state of each row is propagated to other devices

##### Change Optimization
- Intermediate states are eliminated to reduce network traffic
- Multiple updates to the same field are consolidated
- Conflicting changes are resolved according to configured strategies

#### Order Management

##### Ensuring Order Consistency
- Changes are grouped from oldest to newest
- Sequential processing ensures correct application order
- Dependencies between changes are maintained

##### Version Control
- Each change set maintains version information
- Devices can verify the completeness of received changes
- Missing changes can be requested if gaps are detected

### Benefits

- **Reduced Network Traffic**: By eliminating redundant changes
- **Improved Sync Speed**: Through optimized change sets
- **Consistent Data State**: By maintaining proper operation order
- **Resource Efficiency**: Through periodic cleanup of processed changes
